                <h1>Classic Stuffed Peppers</h1>
                The bell pepper is an excellent vessel for stuffing meat, rice, and, of course, cheese. It's strong enough to hold its shape in the oven, and the flavor is subtle enough to go well with just about anything. This is our favorite recipe, but the customization options are endless.

                    Step 1
                    Preheat oven to 400°. In a small saucepan, prepare rice according to package instructions. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Cook onion until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add ground beef and cook, breaking up meat with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, 6 minutes. Drain fat.
                    <br>
                    Step 2
                    Return beef mixture to skillet, then stir in cooked rice and diced tomatoes. Season with oregano, salt, and pepper. Let simmer until liquid has reduced slightly, about 5 minutes.
                    <br>
                    Step 3
                    Place peppers cut side-up in a 9"-x-13" baking dish and drizzle with oil. Spoon beef mixture into each pepper and top with Monterey jack, then cover baking dish with foil.
                    <br>
                    Step 4
                    Bake until peppers are tender, about 35 minutes. Uncover and bake until cheese is bubbly, 10 minutes more.
                    <br>
                    Step 5
                    Garnish with parsley before serving.

                With only 5 ingredients, these black bean tostadas are the easiest and fastest meal to throw together. You can always include additional toppings like corn salsa, avocado ranch, or endless crunchy veggies like radishes or pickled red onions, but these are also delicious if you keep things simple, like we did here.         </div>

Smash with a wooden spoon until most of the beans are smashed with some whole remaining. Add more water as needed to help create a smoother consistency.
                    <br>
                    Step 2
                    Meanwhile, place tostadas on a large baking sheet and sprinkle cheese evenly over each. Bake until cheese is melty, about 5 minutes.

                Want something awesome for dinner but don't want to spend your entire evening cooking and cleaning? Arroz con pollo (chicken with rice in Spanish) is the the perfect recipe. It's an easy one-pot meal that doesn't taste like one, and it tastes even better as leftovers.            </div>

                    Step 1
                    Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then season all over with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, combine cumin, oregano, garlic powder, and cayenne. Rub mixture into chicken.
                    <br>
                    Step 2
                    In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Add chicken and cook until golden, 5 minutes per side. Remove skillet and reserve on a plate.
                    <br>
                    Step 3

                    <br>
                    Step 4
                    Add rice and cook until well coated and toasted, 3 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and diced tomatoes, and bay leaf, stirring up any bits from bottom of pan. Bring to a boil, then add chicken back to skillet. Reduce heat and let simmer, covered, until chicken is cooked through and rice is tender, 30 minutes. Stir occasionally to make sure rice is not sticking to bottom of pan. Add more water or broth as necessary.
                    <br>
                    Step 5
